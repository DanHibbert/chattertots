Over the last few weeks, you have been so patient and encouraging. We now can't stop him talking!'\n\n'Thank you Louise for teaching me to say my 'ck' right.'\n\n'Thank you from all of us for the help you've given N. I'll recommend you to anyone.'\n\n'You have developed a lovely rapport with I which means that she looks forward to coming to see you. The activities you use are engaging and fun, as well as varied, which means she views this as play rather than as a form of schooling.'\n\n'Thank you for all your hard work with P. It is really very noticeable now.'\n\n'I wanted to let you know that C was a narrator in the school nativity play! Thanks for all your help - we sometimes pass your house and C remembers you fondly and the games you played.'\n\n'I would like to thank you for the excellent treatment that you have provided for A that has enabled her to overcome her speech problems.'\n\n'Thank you for helping with my speech. I've had so much fun!'"
